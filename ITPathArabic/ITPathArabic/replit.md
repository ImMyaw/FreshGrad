# IT Certifications Guide

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application built as a comprehensive guide for IT professional certifications across all major technology career paths. The application is designed with a focus on Arabic language support and provides detailed information about various IT certifications spanning 7 major domains: DevOps, IT Infrastructure, Cloud Computing, Cybersecurity, Business Analysis & Project Management, Data Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning.

## System Architecture

The application follows a modern full-stack architecture with the following key components:

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom theming
- **Language Support**: RTL (Right-to-Left) support for Arabic content

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Development**: Vite for development server and HMR
- **Build System**: ESBuild for production builds

### Data Layer
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via Neon serverless)
- **Schema**: Centralized schema definition in shared directory
- **Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
1. **Layout Components**
   - Header with navigation and theme switching
   - Hero section with call-to-action
   - Stats section with animated counters
   - Footer with comprehensive links

2. **Feature Components**
   - Certification cards with filtering and search
   - Search and filter interface
   - Theme provider for dark/light mode support
   - Responsive design for mobile and desktop

3. **UI System**
   - Complete shadcn/ui component library
   - Custom CSS variables for theming
   - Consistent design system with Cairo font
   - Font Awesome icons integration

### Backend Components
1. **Server Setup**
   - Express.js application with middleware
   - Request/response logging
   - Error handling middleware
   - Static file serving in production

2. **Storage Interface**
   - Abstract storage interface (IStorage)
   - Memory storage implementation
   - User management methods
   - Future database integration ready

3. **Development Tools**
   - Vite integration for development
   - Hot module replacement
   - TypeScript compilation
   - Source map support

## Data Flow

1. **Client-Side Rendering**: React application loads in browser
2. **Component Hydration**: Components initialize with static data
3. **User Interactions**: Filtering, searching, and navigation handled client-side
4. **API Communication**: TanStack Query manages server state (prepared for future API endpoints)
5. **Theme Management**: Local storage persistence for user preferences

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React DOM, React Router (Wouter)
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Utilities**: Class-variance-authority, clsx, date-fns

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server**: Express.js, connect-pg-simple for sessions
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, Neon serverless PostgreSQL
- **Development**: Vite, TSX for TypeScript execution
- **Build**: ESBuild for production builds

### Development Dependencies
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across the stack
- **Vite**: Development server and build tool
- **PostCSS**: CSS processing with Tailwind

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- Local development with Vite dev server
- TypeScript compilation on-demand
- Hot module replacement for rapid development
- Replit integration with runtime error overlay

### Production
1. **Build Process**
   - Frontend: Vite builds React application to `dist/public`
   - Backend: ESBuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
   - Static assets served from build directory

2. **Database Migration**
   - Drizzle migrations stored in `migrations/` directory
   - Push schema changes with `npm run db:push`
   - Environment variable `DATABASE_URL` required

3. **Environment Configuration**
   - PostgreSQL connection via `DATABASE_URL`
   - Node environment detection (`NODE_ENV`)
   - Production optimizations enabled

### Scaling Considerations
- Database can be easily switched from memory to PostgreSQL
- API routes ready for implementation in `server/routes.ts`
- Component architecture supports feature expansion
- Internationalization ready (RTL support implemented)
